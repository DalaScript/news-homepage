## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Hooks – useState, useEffect, etc.
- JavaScript (ES6+) – For component logic and interactivity
- CSS Modules / Plain CSS (based on your file structure)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project was my first complete React build done independently, and it was a solid step in structuring components and thinking in terms of reusable UI blocks. I practiced:

 - Building a fully responsive navigation system with a hamburger toggle, `aria-hidden`, and overlay logic for mobile devices.

 - Improved my state management using useState

 - Structuring reusable data-driven components like the `<Card />`, and using `map()` efficiently to render content from arrays.

 - Maintaining a clean separation between presentation and logic, splitting everything into meaningful folders and files.

### Continued development

am currently focused on advancing my skills in both frontend and backend development. On the frontend side, I am exploring modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces.

For backend development, I am working with technologies including Express.js, Next.js, Prisma, MySQL, and TypeScript to gain a deeper understanding of server-side logic, APIs, and database management.

My goal is to become a well-rounded developer by continuously learning and applying these tools in real-world projects.
